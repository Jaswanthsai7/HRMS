# HUMAN RESOURCE MANAGEMENT SYSTEM
HRMS

The function of Human Resource (HR) departments is generally administrative and common 
to all organisation. Organization may have formalized selection, evaluation and payroll 
process. Efficient and effective management of “Human Capital” progressed to on 
increasingly imperative and complex processes. The HR function consists of tracking existing 
employee’s data which traditionally includes personal histories, skills, capabilities, 
accomplishments and salary. To reduce the manual workload of these administrative 
activities, we can electronically automate or edit and even create many of these processes by 
introducing human resource managements system (HRMS).
